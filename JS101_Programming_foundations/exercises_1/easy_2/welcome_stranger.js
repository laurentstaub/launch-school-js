Welcome Stranger

Create a function that takes 2 arguments, an array and an object. The array 
will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, 
will produce a person's name. The object will contain two keys, "title" and 
"occupation", and the appropriate values. Your function should return a 
greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

PEDAC => process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C)

PROBLEM
Identify expected input and output
- input:
  - an array: with two or more elements
  - an object: two keys and their respective values

- output: string

Make the requirements explicit (clarifying questions)
- array contains two or more elements; combined with adjoining spaces to 
produce a person's first and last name (as well as middle name)
- object's keys are title and occupation with appropriate values
- function returns greeting of person's full name and title

Identify rules
- join the elements of the array in the order they are given
- join the values of tile and occupation in this order
- return string

EXAMPLES / TEST CASES
Validate understanding of the problem

Examples:
console.log(
  greetings(["John", "Q", "Doe"], { title: "Master", occupation: "Plumber" })
);
// logs Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.

DATA STRUCTURE
How we represent the data that we will work with when converting the input to output.
- string
- array
- object

ALGORITHM
Steps for converting input to output
- declare function that with two parameters: an array, and an object
- join the strings in the array with the adjoining spaces
- get values from the object's keys
- object returns values from the keys
- return a string with greeting messages
  - "Hello" and "! Nice to have a X around."

CODE
Implementation of Algorithm
*/
function greetings(array, object) {
  let stringFromArray = array.join(" ");
  let stringFromObject = object.title + " " + object.occupation

  return `Hello, ${stringFromArray}! Nice to have a ${stringFromObject} around.`;
}


console.log(
  greetings(["John", "Q", "Doe"], { title: "Master", occupation: "Plumber" })
);
// logs Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.

/* 
OFFICIAL SOLUTION

function greetings(name, status) {
  return `Hello, ${name.join(" ")}! Nice to have a ${status["title"]} ${
    status["occupation"]
  } around.`;
}
